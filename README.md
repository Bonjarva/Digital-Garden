# 🌱 Personal Digital Garden

_A cloud-powered knowledge garden built with Azure_

## 📘 Project Description

The **Personal Digital Garden** is a web application where you can plant, grow, and organize ideas.  
Each entry—called a **seed**—starts small and can evolve into richer content over time.  
The app demonstrates a wide range of Azure developer skills by integrating cloud services across storage, compute, APIs, search, and security.

This project is part of my 3-month learning plan to prepare for the **Azure Developer Associate (AZ-204)** certification.

---

## 🌿 What the App Will Eventually Do

- Create, edit, and delete “seeds” (notes/ideas)
- Group seeds into “plots” (topics or categories)
- Upload images or files to seeds
- Search entries using **Azure AI Search**
- Sync updates in real time using **Azure SignalR Service**
- Display analytics such as trends, tags, and activity
- Provide a fully deployed, cloud-hosted web app with CI/CD
- Use secure authentication using **Azure AD B2C**

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

### **Frontend**

- React (or Next.js)
- TailwindCSS (optional)
- Hosted on **Azure Static Web Apps**

### **Backend**

- **Azure Functions** (serverless APIs)
- **Azure SignalR Service** for real-time updates
- **Azure API Management** (optional milestone)

### **Data & Storage**

- **Azure Cosmos DB** (NoSQL storage for seeds + plots)
- **Azure Blob Storage** (file + image uploads)
- **Azure AI Search** (full-text search)

### **Security & Identity**

- **Azure AD B2C** for authentication
- Secrets handled via **Azure Key Vault**

### **Deployment & DevOps**

- GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- Optional: Infrastructure as Code using **Bicep** or **Terraform**
